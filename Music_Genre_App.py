**Our goal is to help in identifying music genres from audio tracks efficiently. Upload an audio file, and our system will analyze it to detect its genre. Discover the power of AI in music analysis!**

### How It Works
1. **Upload Audio:** Go to the **Genre Classification** page and upload an audio file.
2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the audio using advanced algorithms to classify it into one of the predefined genres.
3. **Results:** View the predicted genre along with related information.

### Why Choose Us?
- **Accuracy:** Our system leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models for accurate genre prediction.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for a smooth user experience.
- **Fast and Efficient:** Get results quickly, enabling faster music categorization and exploration.

### Get Started
Click on the **Genre Classification** page in the sidebar to upload an audio file and explore the magic of our Music Genre Classification System!

                ### About Project
                Music. Experts have been trying for a long time to understand sound and what differenciates one song from another. How to visualize sound. What makes a tone different from another.

                This data hopefully can give the opportunity to do just that.

                ### About Dataset
                #### Content
                1. **genres original** - A collection of 10 genres with 100 audio files each, all having a length of 30 seconds (the famous GTZAN dataset, the MNIST of sounds)
                2. **List of Genres** - blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock
                3. **images original** - A visual representation for each audio file. One way to classify data is through neural networks. Because NNs (like CNN, what we will be using today) usually take in some sort of image representation, the audio files were converted to Mel Spectrograms to make this possible.
                4. **2 CSV files** - Containing features of the audio files. One file has for each song (30 seconds long) a mean and variance computed over multiple features that can be extracted from an audio file. The other file has the same structure, but the songs were split before into 3 seconds audio files (this way increasing 10 times the amount of data we fuel into our classification models). With data, more is always better.
